## Why C for Machine Learning

I am interested in Machine Learning and I have been 
learning C for a while so why not? Also, I have a 
great source.

I know that these machine learning codes are very basic, 
but also I know the fact that to learn something fancy
you should first learn and do the "boring" (even if I don't 
believe that the codes I have written are boring) things. 
Essentially, that's what I do here.
